# Beard Classifier
A beard classifier fine-tuned using ResNet50 that classifies beard with 97% accuracy!

I have used a ResNet50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and **fine-tuned** it. The model has been trained on **19K** images(beard and non-beard). The model has been tested on **2K** images that have been scraped from Google. It classifies the images with an accuracy of 97%!

## Dependencies
